ChIJ-Y0h5itd1moRjNO5-_4SVVE,"Absolutely amazing coffee! During our stay in Melbourne we visited Code Black Coffee on Spencer Street multiple times and tried the cold brews, several batch brews, and pour overs – every single one was outstanding. The service was consistently 5-star, with staff who are not only friendly but also incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates quality coffee and great hospitality! | Date of visit: 07/10/2025 Time: 4:08:45PM First time customer here and came in for a quick coffee on my way home from work. The man at the cashier Moses provided exceptional customer service. I asked what milk coffee do you offer and he said full cream only but assured me it’s the best milk to use for a white coffee. He was right. Tasted absolutely fantastic. I noticed he was supportive to the other baristas working behind the bar and making sure everything was under control, which is lovely to see. Great coffee and great vibe. Will definitely be back.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJnwkZOqND1moR8sSB0apJ4_Y,"Contrary to the warm service and the atmosphere of this modern dessert bar, the coldness of the desserts are only contrasted by their lack of complexity in flavour and overbearingness. This is in no fault of the staff. Whilst visually they're beautiful and striking and the texture interesting and varying, the flavour takes all attention from that in such a profoundly negative manner that I was left in awe at the high price tag. I would only return here for the work or date friendly atmosphere, staff, and rather pleasant coffee. | I am not type or person who ate cake often. But I like Reynold and his creation so I went to try. Cakes are nice,fresh(to me compare to few shop that feel frozen and old). I could see each components, it's interesting to see. The taste are good but Im not expert. only one down point for me is a bit pricey. But I understand somehow as they sell for technique and ideas. So It's kind of you eat art piece.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJOfotPd1D1moRKBrT3Juq8fQ,"Classy atmosphere, super friendly staff and delicious food!!! Perfect spot to chill and study during the week! Their Porchetta focaccia is the bomb! The crispy pork belly is next level goodness! In terms of flavour I would say best in melb!!! The chicken Cotoletta too super flavourful!! | A quick stop for coffee and croissant and boy is there pan au chocolat nice and chocolatey. Every single bit. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Good find! Musics a bit loud so not a quiet coffee place. They have sandwiches and salads as well that could be worth a try if the croissants were so good!",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

There’s Vietnamese iced coffee was also great. Everything is very reasonably priced making it the perfect cheap breakfast or lunch spot. Staff were very friendly too. | Cute little bakery, Vietnamese restaurant tucked away down a lane. You might miss it!

I can’t wait to come back. The staff were absolutely lovely and very attentive, the venue is stunning, the food was fresh and great portion sizes. Added bonus, a violinist while you enjoyed your tea. | My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary with afternoon tea at Collins Coffee House. The historic building and eclectic seating add to the atmosphere and the food was lovely. There was an interesting variety of savouries and sweets even with their gluten free items which I required, and the service was attentive. It was a delightful experience.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJWeak6YBD1moRtfyrERisY4Q,"The most amazing coffee. You have to try the dirty coconut coffee from their Signature Dirty Coffees menu! The staff are also super friendly. My wife had the Morning Bar Coco which she loved and said it wasn't too sweet. | If you are looking for the Melbourne coffee culture, this is the place you have to visit to get the experience. Excellent location in the CBD area, underground atmosphere, and friendly staff. If you want to go out of your comfy zone, the Dirty Coconut coffee is highly recommended!! Enjoy 😉",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJT61MWNlD1moRbJAotYDnIGQ,"Finally tried Lune as I’m usually buying from Agathe or South Melbourne bakery. We tried a few and the quality is good, crunchy and soft. Our favourite was the ham and cheese, absolutely delicious. Always wondered about the line every weekend and then we saw how small it is on the inside. Quality might have something to do with it too. They’re expensive but what isn’t these days. Service was excellent. Thank you 🙏 | I was here for at least 3 times over a week during my holidays here in late July. That explains how good the pastry here is. Tasted almost everything that is offered here. Price is on the high side, but the quality made it up. This cafe is a bit small, more suitable for takeaway or a quick bite before you move on. There is road side parking just right in front of the cafe so it is very convenient for those who drives.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJSxIgKrRC1moR16XSMelL-sg,"Amazing stuff. Has these for the first time in Sydney and it's sad that Melbourne doesn't have more locations. The cheesecakes are light fluffy and creaming. Just amazing. The Madeline have the most wonderful honey scent, perfect with a cup of black tea. I also got myself a mango cream crepe, messy to eat so I would recommend sit down and eat it in a bowl with a fork. But it's amazing. None of the desserts are too sweet, just the perfect amount, which is the best compliment for Asian sweets. Definitely give it a try if you are interested in Japanese style sweet. I came at 11:50am and was the first person in line for 12pm opening, worth it seeing the care being put into the making process. | Loved their cheesecake, it’s soft, not too airy or dense, and doesn’t have that eggy taste some cheesecakes do. I also tried their crème brûlée crepe, which was creamy and packed with strawberry filling and two slices of cheesecake inside. Definitely worth trying at least once!",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJ25x2xuFd1moRVl-vqCL_ZGo,"We tried their famous Peanut Cream Latte $7.70 – not really our taste 😅 it just tastes like peanut butter! The flavour is unique though — maybe others would enjoy it more. The café is cozy and nicely designed. There’s always a line, but it moves quickly. Might come back to try other flavours next time. | Visiting this cafe has become part of my weekly routine, even though I’ve only ever ordered one drink. The Peanut Creme Latte is so good that I just keep coming back for it! The customer service is great, with staff who are always cheerful and accommodating. It can get quite busy at peak hours, but the queues move quickly. Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the CBD.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJw3ZAzdJD1moRdTHBsWBAcao,"I always go to Maker. The coffee is very consistent and really good. I usually get Batch brews, but I’ve tried latte, flat white, macchiato, long black, and mocha. I prefer getting just batch brew or a regular latte. Always ask for the bean! It’s so interesting reading the description of what you’re drinking | The environment in the store is great! It's very atmospheric to shoot casually! The coffee beans used in the store are also very good. Because my friend didn't have lunch that day, I ordered a tiramisu. I didn't expect it to be a Swiss roll type. Unexpectedly, I found that it was delicious. There were a lot of people in the store, but it didn't affect my chatting with my friends. Moreover, this restaurant is not like other stores that will drive away when they are about to close. Customer, the clerk is very friendly.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJywGq8jRd1moR5nQ1m6DgWEI,"Came across Cafe Belt when I was looking for a good coffee in town, an interesting few choices on the menu, so I tried something new, the Vegeta, coffee with Edememe Milk, it was rich, mildly sweet & very smooth, my friend had a hot chocolate which he said was delicious. I definitely recommend a visit if your from our of town like me, it would be a regular for anyone local. Customer service was great, so friendly & accommodating, thanks for a wonderful experience | A little cafe at the roadside, popular and cozy. kind and friendly staff providing good service. Limited choice for breakfast, only pastries. Ordered an almond croissant and long black large. The long black was unexpectedly good, it had a a fruity smell and taste, not able to taste any outstanding flavor, but already quite amazing that it was without a little bitterness . The almond croissant was full of almond on top, it was slightly crispy outside, but too soft inside, and the sweetness dominated the taste, very little to no butter flavor could be tasted. Total $12.5 cash. Worth coming back for the coffee and cozy environment, for working but may not want to have the pastries.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

ChIJxRIPiMlC1moRLSuO5kfDqC0,"I have visited Dessert Story quite many times in the past 2 years. My favourite desserts are always the traditional grass jelly with various toppings and the mango sago.😋 The price level is quite reasonable. The staffs are nice and welcoming, though they were usually very busy. If you are from HK / PRC, you can probably speak Cantonese or Putonghua for ordering if you like. | Dessert Story is a reliable fix for late-night cravings in the CBD. The shop glows with pink signage and a wall of illustrated menus, so you can scope out your order before reaching the counter. Seating runs along communal benches and small tables tucked by the windows; it fills quickly after dinner hours but turn-over is fast enough that a spot usually opens within minutes. The menu leans Taiwanese, offering chewy taro balls over silky tofu pudding, grass jelly with red beans, and shaved ice piled high with fresh mango when it is in season. Portion sizes are generous and built for sharing. My go-to mix is the warm ginger syrup bowl topped with sweet potato balls that stay springy to the last spoonful. Drinks cover the bubble-tea basics, with brown sugar milk tea landing rich and perfectly balanced, boba still warm from the pot. Staff keep the line moving with brisk efficiency, calling orders by number and offering containers if you decide to take dessert on the run. Prices sit in that sweet spot between university-budget friendly and dessert-bar indulgent, so trying a couple of different toppings does not sting the wallet. The store stays open well past most cafés, making it a handy final stop after a movie or night class. For colourful comfort sweets, quick service, and a menu that encourages repeat visits, Dessert Story holds its place as a city staple.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

ChIJNbbeGhpD1moRYhlJy2LyBRY,"I've visited twice and the desserts are always great. I've previously gotten the Green Tea Chocolate Bingsu to share, which was really nice & aesthetic. Last time I got a combo of strawberry shortcake & an iced tiramisu latte, the cake was delicious & the coffee too, but maybe a regular latte would do the trick for me since I didn't need that much sugar. | You can’t go wrong with Sulbing, especially if you’re craving bingsu! The sweetness is just right, the texture is smooth, and the serving sizes are generous with beautiful presentation. The seating is comfortable, making it a great spot to wind down and satisfy your sweet tooth. Their cake was incredibly soft and delicious too. The only slight letdown was the black sesame latte—it didn’t quite live up to the rest of the experience.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJPw7i7p9D1moRSuTZnGRGtBo,"Thought I'd try this place out since they have 1000s of stores in China and have low calorie americanos. I don't drink Americanos often but these flavored ones were pretty good, tried both the pomelo (you need to like a slightly sour taste) and coconut water. Extra star for the mega bottle which can be reused as a gym bottle. | It‘s my favourite cafe in Shanghai！I can’t believe I can see it in Melbourne！it looks so good and tastes well！",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJKZzZHgBD1moRJ4lAT5gtxk8,"I ducked into the Mitchell House Market Lane on a busy morning and walked out grinning. The little corner space has that clean, art deco feel, all light wood, soft lighting and a bar that lets you watch the shots being pulled. Music sits low, grinders purr in the background and the whole room smells like freshly ground beans. It is the kind of place where you relax as soon as your hands wrap around a warm cup. The coffee is the headline and it absolutely delivers. My flat white was balanced and silky, with a chocolate and stone fruit thing happening that lingered without turning bitter. A follow up pour over showed off their lighter roast side, bright and sweet with a citrus lift that stayed clean all the way to the last sip. Milk is textured properly so the first sip matches the last, and if you are into filters, the baristas are happy to talk through what is on the bar and point you to something that suits your mood. Pastries in the cabinet are fresh and not an afterthought, perfect if you want a small bite with your cup. Service is what keeps me coming back. The team is quick, friendly and clearly cares about the details. If there is a line, it moves, and orders land in your hands faster than you expect. Shelves of beans and brewing gear make it easy to take something home, with roast dates and tasting notes that are actually useful. Seating is limited, so plan on takeaway or a quick stand at the bar during the morning rush. Tip: ask for a recommendation, try the batch if you are in a hurry, and grab a bag for later. Consistently excellent coffee, zero fuss and a calm pocket right in the CBD. | By far the best coffee (flat white especially) I found in Melbourne to my liking. Tried several famous cafes in Melbourne but nothing beats this place. Also the beautiful facade and interior design. Beware that there's no sitting inside. They also don't serve any pastries if you're looking for any bites.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

Highly recommended for anyone looking to experience the best of Colombian cuisine in Melbourne! | Absolutely love Encanto! I’ve been twice now and it’s quickly become one of my favourite spots in Melbourne. The food is incredible — every dish I’ve tried has been bursting with flavour, and the portion sizes are huge (I’ve never been able to finish a main!).

They kept smiling at the white customers, but were extremely impatient when I ordered. As a foreigner, I was a bit confused and asked very politely, but they had a really bad attitude and were super mean. | I decided to try this coffee because it looks nice from the outside. Unfortunately by the professional look, they gave me an unbranded cup 😂 even worse that a convenient store coffee, they still have their own branded cup. The flat white has too much milk taste, I couldnt taste the coffee. And had to finish as quick as I can, coz its not good.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc
ChIJ39GiLxdd1moR3M_M-48jQoE,"I love Bingsu and decided to give this place a try after my friends kept raving about it. I tried their signature Thai Tea Bingsu, the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu, and the Pandan & Coconut Shokupan. The Thai Tea Bingsu could’ve been a bit sweeter for my taste, but the Mango Sticky Rice one was really unique and flavorful. The Pandan & Coconut Shokupan was the highlight—so soft and delicious! The portion sizes are a bit smaller compared to other Bingsu places I’ve been to, so keep that in mind. Also, the space is quite small and seating is tight, so it might not be ideal for big groups. Still, if you’re a dessert lover, it’s definitely worth a visit! | If you’re looking for the perfect sweet treat after a meal, this is definitely the place to be! Their desserts are not only delicious but also perfect for sharing with a couple of friends. I came here with a few mates after dinner and we decided to try their famous bingsu. We went for the mango sticky rice flavor this time, and wow… it was honestly amazing! The mango was fresh, sweet, and juicy, the sticky rice had the perfect chewy texture, and the creamy shaved ice just tied everything together beautifully. Every bite felt refreshing yet satisfying, not overly sweet, just right. It’s the kind of dessert that makes you want to slow down and enjoy every spoonful. We couldn’t stop talking about how good it was, and by the time we finished, the bowl was completely clean. If you’re a fan of mango, you’ll love it, but even if you’re not, I think it’s still worth giving it a try because the balance of flavors is just spot on. Highly recommend bringing your friends here after lunch or dinner—you’ll leave with a happy stomach and a smile. Definitely worth coming back for more!",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

Service was efficient and friendly. | Indonesian trying the food in here. So far so good. Its also good location to enjoy the feel and environment. Last time I ordered Nasi lemak. Nasi lemak is good but unfortunately when I ate, the rice is kind of hard to eat its like leftover rice and the cucumber is already old.

ChIJQfl0JgBd1moRJv7zHmKAPyU,"Our fusion linguine and croissant meal were very delicious 👍 Matchamisu was nicely done too! Overall, it was a fantastic lunch experience. | We ordered: • Go-Miso Soft Shell Crab Linguine ($32) • Unagi Don ($28) The Go-Miso Soft Shell Crab Linguine was extremely salty and heavy. I understand miso itself is salty, but it felt one-dimensional—just saltiness without much balance or creativity. I had to keep drinking water, but it still left me feeling parched. The Unagi Don was also disappointing. The eel tasted like it had been frozen—the texture was soft and lacked freshness. The flavor relied heavily on the eel sauce, which was overly sweet and cloying. The rice, however, was pleasantly chewy. The biggest letdown was the Lemonricano ($7). I expected something refreshing—black Americano with lemon—but instead, it came with a huge amount of granulated sugar sitting at the bottom, completely unmixed. Each sip tasted more like sugar than coffee, which made it undrinkable for me. I only managed two or three sips before leaving it aside. We finished our meal in about 15 minutes. Service was polite and attentive, but the dining environment felt rather basic. Sadly, both my husband and I felt unusually thirsty for hours afterward, even after drinking lots of water. Overall, it didn’t live up to the expectations I had when I first saw the menu.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

ChIJ64HO4H1d1moRofkkKD8rPNU,"This was my first time trying the matcha latte with the edible cup, and I was really excited, but unfortunately, I ended up disappointed with both the service and the drink. The staff at the POS wasn’t friendly at all. I asked for my drink to be extra hot, but it wasn’t even warm enough. (I’m not sure if you can actually make it “extra hot” with the edible cup, but when I ordered, they didn’t mention anything about it, so I assumed it was possible 🤷‍♀️). I ended up paying $9.70, which definitely didn’t feel worth it. I don’t even understand why I was charged that much. (The menu says matcha is $5 for small, $5.50 for medium, and $6 for large. The edible cup is $3, but it was pretty small too.) It would have been nice if the staff had given me a little heads-up about the total price before charging me. | I have my first micha here and they serve it nice.

ChIJDXV6iKBD1moRUOWjs6BRp9s,"We visited Time Lapse while travelling in Melbourne and unfortunately, the experience was the complete opposite of what the name suggests. Instead of a quick, seamless brunch, time seemed to crawl. We ordered two dishes and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was excellent — rich, intense, and beautifully made. It arrived quickly, giving us hope that the rest of the meal would follow soon. Unfortunately, the food took more than 40 minutes to arrive, completely throwing off our morning schedule. It was clear the kitchen was understaffed, but a simple heads-up about the delay would have been appreciated. Waiting that long on hard wooden seats only made things worse — they were really uncomfortable after a while. When the food finally came, it didn’t make up for the wait. I ordered the steak and egg, but the steak was tough and far from tender. It felt like a battle with every bite and I could not even swallow 30% of the meat they served. For a place that prides itself on serving quality Australian ingredients and brunch dishes, this was very disappointing. Overall, Time Lapse lived up to its name only in irony — everything took far too long, and the food just wasn’t worth it. The hot chocolate was the sole highlight, but that alone isn’t enough to recommend this place. I wouldn’t return or suggest it to others. | Beautiful spot, really good food.

Did not try other beverages. Overall - Cafe was bustling with decent line on a Monday afternoon (4pm). Cute atmosphere in the cafe but you’re on your own to scout for seats (only after you order at the counter).

ChIJt7LprCJd1moRmpzkQrWU3HQ,"I absolutely love this place! I was in Melbourne for vacation and I had breakfast there 4 days in a row! I fell in love with their truffle soup. Their toffee coffee was so delicious and their pastry’s were also good. The staff was always friendly. The tables were always clean. | Been waiting to visit this place for the longest time because it is located in the Melbourne CBD area that I don’t really usually go to I love all the pastries especially the savoury ones. Then new brunch menu items such as their Bugoy eggs Benedict on top of a nicely flaky croissant bread or toast was the highlight. It was a perfect balance of sweet and salty and textures as well. I also love their in infused desserts and drinks, and the coffee is very strong bold but not bitter. Matcha was definitely on the sweeter side. Heard mixed reviews about the Pandoro but I don’t think they have that any more. Instead they’ve got new viral pastries like the square cube croissant as well as the Dubai chocolate croissant I really liked their signature baked goods such as the garlic cream cheese, brioche bread which was nicely toasted and super creamy in the centre. I found a lot of their dishes on the sweeter side than usual Korean bakeries but extremely buttery in the best way possible, hence the butter room. Great service very attentive.

Bought the strawberry crepe slice, chocolate crepe slice and cardamon biscotti basque cheesecake for a colleague's birthday. We all ended up sharing. Loved the crepe cake slices. Personally, I found the cardamon flavour overpowered everything else in the basque cheesecake slice. Though I guess it would be enjoyable for anyone who really loves the taste of cardamon | Amazing food! So beautifully presented like a work of art.

ChIJYb_LZKFD1moR7jLuYnSVuJo,"Visited to try the fluffy jiggly pancakes at Kumo Desserts. We went for pistachio papi and strawberry skies with whipped cream, and they were divine! The pistachio one was sweet, nutty, and rich in flavour, while the portion size was generous and filling. We paired them with an iced Thai lime tea and a mandarin yuzu light, tangy, and super refreshing for a sunny day. They also offer a lovely range of other hot and cold drinks.

On top of that, the coffee was far too acidic, though I’ll give credit that the citrus tart was actually quite good.

This Japanese-inspired bakery serves some of the city’s finest pastries — flaky, buttery, and beautifully crafted. The Yuzu Almond Croissant and Blueberry Danish are absolute standouts, combining delicate flavour with perfect texture. The shop is small and mostly takeaway, but watching the bakers at work adds to its charm. Prices are a little high, and popular items sell out fast, so going early is a must. Overall, Bakemono Bakers delivers top-tier quality and creativity A must-visit for pastry lovers in Melbourne. | Down an alleyway, baked goods smell wafting down the street beside it. Good coffee and great Yuzu Almond Croissant. Flaky pastry, little chew on the middle to break up the flakiness, the hint of Yuzu breaks the croissant's butteriness and sweetness of the almonds. Worth the money and short walk from where we are staying. Line at the front but wasn't to bad and it moved fairly rapidly.

The pastries are truly so good 🥐, and although it’s not the most glamorous one to choose (because there are so many great options here!), I *always* order the Pain au chocolat 🍫💫. It is flaky and not too sweet and maybe my favourite pastry in all of Melbourne ☺️ | Discovered Bloomwood Café recently and it was such a delightful experience! 🌿☕ I tried their Strawberry Matcha 🍓🍵 and absolutely loved it—it was refreshing, beautifully balanced, and such a unique twist on a classic matcha latte. My friend ordered a cappuccino ☕ and enjoyed it just as much, describing it as smooth, rich, and perfectly made. One thing that really stood out was the variety of bakery options 🥐🍩🍰 on display. Everything looked so tempting! We didn’t get a chance to try them this time, but it definitely gives us a reason to come back soon. From pastries to cakes, the spread looked fresh and inviting—perfect for pairing with a coffee or specialty drink. The café itself has a really lovely vibe ✨. The outdoor seating 🌞🌿 is a big plus, especially if you enjoy soaking up some sun or people-watching while you sip your coffee.

We enjoyed their strawberry shortcake and matcha and early grey basque cheesecake. Both were not too sweet and the perfect treat. Keen to revisit to try some of their other cakes and drinks. | First time tried out this patisserie. I ordered delivery as I lived far from this Bakery.

ChIJoSk-GABd1moRVz2ICmTIRiM,"A popular bakery near Queen Victoria Markets. I decided to give it a try, after some recommendations.

The bakery also sells coffee and there is a small area to enjoy your food. I recommend to go early, as it gets quite busy. Worth a visit if you are closeby! | We dropped in near closing time and picked up an absolutely delicious blueberry danish.

They're quite large and very filling, so sharing might be a good idea. | Loved this place, went almost every day during my stay. They have 4 different vegan options but I confess to only trying 2 even though I must’ve bought at least 12 of them over a few days. 😅 The kale and leek is phenomenal, it is spicy though, which isn’t mentioned, so just a heads up.

And this one did not disappoint! Despite eating it straight out of the paper bag (which someone felt anti-Easter, hot cross buns ought to be toasted and slathered with butter), it was still so soft and fresh, really balanced with the spices and full of fruit. The staff are always lovely as well! Edited to add - also tried the pain au raisin and while it was soft, full of sultanas and the perfect size for me (often they are way too big so I either eat it all and feel sick, or can't finish and it's a waste), the pastry lacked flavour.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

The only seating area is a row of table facing the window, so I’m guessing most people will be doing takeaway.

I may go in and try their croissants next time. | I've been a fan of their cakes since 5 years ago. When I heard that they opened their branch in the CBD, I knew I had to visit.

ChIJm8e-QD1d1moRBU7gF3tr-LU,"Majesty coffee has a a nice atmosphere, probably best suited for smaller groups. The service was nice, very sweet and friendly. Strawberry cloud — 5.5/10 For a whopping $16 you get really cute presentation but a matcha that unfortunately does not meet the standards for both taste and amount. The matcha flavour was lacklustre, the overpowering strawberry flavour morphing the drink into something more like strawberry milk. Berry Nice Latte (w/ soy milk)— 4/10 At $14 this coffee is much more expensive compared to a standard coffee. Again, unfortunately the taste did not live up to a $14 coffee standard. The crushed dehydrated berries on top were a nice addition, but the coffee itself was way waaaay too sweet. The more I drank the sweeter it got. The coffee is missing the berry element, the caramel syrup is much more prominent. I would highly recommend that Majesty coffee try to make the strawberry cloud and berry nice latte much less sweet! Other than that, the presentation was indeed very lovely 😊 | As a professional chef, I'm always on the lookout for places that put care and technique into what they do, and St. Ali was a pleasant surprise. You won’t find an overwhelming menu or pretentious presentations here — but everything you order is well-executed, with quality and great flavor. The atmosphere is super relaxed and cozy, perfect for enjoying a coffee, chatting with someone, or just taking a break from your day. It feels warm, welcoming, and unhurried — like a little pocket of calm. The service was excellent — fast, friendly, and professional. It's always a pleasure to be welcomed with a smile and served efficiently. The savory food was the highlight. I had a ham and cheese croissant that was absolutely amazing — flaky, buttery, and perfectly baked. We also tried a Cuban-style bagel, which was full of flavor and had great texture. The menu is short but carefully curated: croissants, bagels, baguettes... simple things, but done really well. The coffee was great, and while the chai latte didn’t really stand out, it wasn’t bad either. The strength of the place is definitely in its savory offerings and the way they pair bread and fillings to create something simple but memorable. In short, St. Ali isn’t trying to do everything — just doing a few things really well, and you can tell. If you love enjoying a great croissant with a quality coffee in a relaxed and welcoming setting, this is definitely a place worth visiting. ✨ Highly recommended if you appreciate quality, friendly service, and well-executed flavors.",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

Highly recommend for anyone who loves coffee and good vibes! | A hidden coffee shop in a lane. Ran by one person. Ordered an egg salad with black pepper toast and a long black. The egg salad with black pepper was in large portion, the black pepper did a great job in adding flavour to the originally ordinary egg salad, making it less heavy to finish. The toast was well toasted. The long black was nutty in nature. The bitterness and woody flavour was the first to be tasted, then the aftertaste became sweet interestingly (subjective).

They take pride in the freshness of all products served in the store, not limited to just banh mi! I was impressed by their offer of a variety of hot pies, like this delicious Thai Green Curry Pie, even if not technically Vietnamese, was delicious nonetheless. When looking around, I wasn't the only one to think so either as most tables had ordered a pastry of some kind to go with their coffee too! They aren't the most filled banh mi in the city but pack a lot of flavour into their freshly baked bread rolls and are still very much worthy of a visit if you want something satisfying without being too heavy. Their signature is the Crispy Pork Roll which was exactly that, and the Satay Chicken Salad Roll provided a fresh take on the traditional sandwich (although it could have been done with more Satay sauce so make sure to ask for extra when ordering!). The Bacon & Egg Roll was my favourite and was as good for lunch as it is for breakfast. Had with a coffee, this was a winning combo and much better than your average two fried eggs on toast!

The liquid inside oozes out everywhere and seeps out of the choux creating a sticky mess. It was not pleasant and I discarded over half of the product. Disappointing | I found the male staff member to be quite impatient and somewhat annoyed while I was trying to confirm which items were still in stock. He repeatedly stated, “Everything is available except for hazelnut and lychee & raspberry.” This was confusing for me because lychee & raspberry was not listed among the available flavors on the product list on the countertop or on the poster next to the cashier. Additionally, the display shelf was empty except for choux, which led me to believe that most of the croissants were already sold out. I got the impression that I had misunderstood him, so I attempted to reconfirm the information. In terms of the croissant's quality, while the crust was crispy, the filling fell short of my expectations. It had only a thin layer of filling, leaving the center of the croissant hollow. As a result, all the sauce oozed out when I took a bite.

It's thickened on the steel pan and it's fun to watch it being put together. 🥜 For taste, the yoghurt is sweet and tangy. Even though I asked for a lychee base, the taste was too subtle for me to detect. There were chia seeds and nuts put in (they do ask you about allergies) so there was some nice texture.

Onigiri was simple but really good, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. I recommend if you are craving light, healthy dish! We also had kinako matcha and lavender matcha - both very delicious and would def get them again. | Went for a quick bite for breakfast at Operator San, and left very satisfied. The atmosphere is cosy and inviting—perfect for coffee dates and catching up with friends, but could have the potential to feel slightly crowded and claustrophobic when going at peak hours. It also seems to be very welcoming to families and children. Observing the service, we found that most of the staff members seemed extremely friendly, except for the girl who was serving us, but it was honestly nothing major—we appreciate her for serving us!! We went at around 9:00am and did not have to wait long for food and drink. Onigiri Set — 8/10 The shiitake flavoured onigiri was the star for me. It was so packed full of the shiitake flavour—sooo delicious. Salmon cooked to perfection, juicy and flaky. Overall, a very balanced dish—sweet tamago contrasts both the savoury onigiri and miso soup while the pickles undercut the fattiness of the salmon. It is on the pricier side but definitely worth trying. Lavender Matcha — 9/10 The taste of the lavender worked so incredibly beautifully with the matcha. Sweetness was just right, very smooth, creamy and addictive. Only downside is that you get less than what you usually would with a standard matcha latte at $10. Highly recommend! Matcha Kinako — 7.5/10 Again, sweetness was just right and the kinako worked well with the matcha. No strong notes of coconut from the coconut foam which I did not mind, as the kinako flavour here is the true star of the show. Slightly less smooth due to the kinako itself but would highly suggest for those who are DF to try!",cafe_brunch_bakery_desc

The place is clearly popular, there were plenty of people seated inside when I was there and plenty ordering takeaway too, even the cafe is not in what you’d call the busiest part of town. I ordered mixed chicken and lamb, sauce on the side, with salad and a few randomly sprinkled jalapeños on top. I have rarely chosen this wisely. The meat was fantastic. Fresh as a daisy and really tender and nicely flavoured. The salad was great too. The dish was so good, I actually went back for a second helping, a very rare thing. It was delicious. These Keto people might be on to something, you know. Service here was brisk and snappy. Pleasant if you showed some interest. I’d expect nothing less. Was that a Turkish or Arab hip hop playlist that was briefly on on house sound system? It was growing on me. Vibe Kebas is a great spot for a quick tasty and cheap meal or snack. It delivers and at very reasonable prices. Highly recommended. | Wow just wow. The guy behind the counter is an absolute legend. Best snack pack in Melbourne. Crispy delicious chips, topped with cheesy goodness then topped with succulent lamb and juicy flavoursome chicken then topped with cheese again and finished with the holy trinity of sauces. BBQ, garlic and chilli. What a sight for sore eyes. This is a work of art was only $15 and it included a can of drink. Can’t get any better than this. Best snack pack in Melbourne I repeat!

ChIJAdALCU5d1moRvEjyFnz1mOI,"I frequently purchase the Vegetarian Basil and Chili on Steamed Rice and have for many years. I rate this meal and its flavour the best Thai basil chili meal in Melbourne CBD and have recommended it to many people and taken many friends there to enjoy it. The meal includes a fried egg and cost $15.90. In the last few days/weeks, the same meal has increased $1 and no longer includes a fried egg which is now an optional extra at $3. To get the meal that once cost $15.90 is now $19.90. A massive 25% increase. The meal is small to begin with (ideal for me), but my recent experience after the price increase, was disappointing. The vegetables seem to have more inexpensive onion, it had absolutely no Thai basil in it and without the egg, the mound of rice was dry and unenjoyable. Now, at $19.90 for the same small meal with egg is not worth my money for the small portion size. Photos attached are the meal with egg at $15.90 in August 2025 and the meal in September 2025 without egg. You may think its the same, just missing the egg, but there was more changes than that. I accept an increase in meal price, especially with rising costs of ingredients, energy, store rent, staff wages, etc, but to remove the egg from the meal and charge $3 extra for an egg is excessive. Unfortunately I can no longer recommend this store to friends or ""customers"" in my line of work. I will be exploring other Thai stores. Tip for anyone who buys takeaway to eat the next day, watch the cardboard container and rice dont absorb any juices/flavours overnight because this makes the meal somewhat dry the next day. Transfer it to a plate when you get home, tilt it to keep juices away from the rice. | NAM is an incredible asset to your restaurant! Her service and the food are a perfect 1000/10!

ChIJhz6IIUxd1moRgvCJ4fDtBjQ,"The food is tasty, fresh and reasonably priced, although it’d have been nicer to have more chilli con carne, and less of the other toppings, as the sour cream made the food cold.

I would have been more understanding if the server had been friendly, but this wasn’t the case - customer service needs improving. | Located in food court. Very busy in lunch time for office workers.

ChIJBaUBTrRC1moRNdF-YqUyESg,"Let’s begin with the basics, this place doesn’t seem to understand the difference between high tea and afternoon tea, which is unfortunately all too common in Australia. It would be worth brushing up on the definitions before making bold claims. If you’re someone who values the authenticity of British traditions, consider yourself warned. The venue itself is tiny, truly difficult to find, and sadly, any sense of elegance or refinement is lost the moment you step inside. A handful of tables were occupied, none of them particularly clean, and the overall atmosphere was one of a place in decline. It feels poorly maintained, with no effort made to live up to the sophistication typically associated with a proper afternoon tea experience. To their credit, there is a decent tea selection. Thank you for that. However, the dessert offering was minimal, and what was there looked rather tired and uninviting. The staff were friendly and polite, which was a small redeeming feature, but unfortunately not enough to salvage the experience. In short, if you’re up for a bit of a challenge or enjoy novelty over quality, give it a go. Otherwise, you might be better off elsewhere. | The best cup of tea I’ve ever had. Cannot find fault.

ChIJQwd52MdC1moRp_Up79F6RP8,"😁🔥 An Outstanding Lunch Experience at Earl Canteen (45 Collins St.) If you’re in Melbourne’s CBD and looking for a spot that perfectly balances fresh, high-quality ingredients with a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere, look no further than Earl Canteen. I recently had the pleasure of visiting their Collins Street location, and I can confidently say that it exceeded my expectations in every possible way 🌟. 🥪🥖 Let me start with the food, which is the highlight of this gem. I decided to try their Chicken & Hummus Sandwich ($16.50), and it was, without exaggeration, one of the best sandwiches I’ve had in a long time. The chicken was perfectly cooked—juicy and tender—while the hummus provided the right amount of creaminess that balanced the flavors beautifully. What really stood out was the attention to the finer details. You can tell that the ingredients are sourced thoughtfully; every element in the sandwich felt fresh and packed with flavor. Whether it was the crispness of the vegetables or the softness of the bread, each bite felt carefully crafted. Earl Canteen doesn’t just serve “food”; they create a meal that feels nourishing and indulgent at the same time. You can truly taste the difference when the team behind the counter cares about the quality of what they serve. It’s clear that they’ve put a lot of thought into their menu, offering options that cater to a variety of preferences and dietary needs, without sacrificing flavor or creativity 🌿. If the chicken and hummus sandwich is any indication of their other offerings, I can’t wait to come back and explore more of their menu! 🤩🎉 The ambiance of the space also deserves a special mention 🏙️. In the heart of Collins St., Earl Canteen provides a calm and cozy escape from the busy hustle and bustle of the city. The interior is modern yet comfortable, with a minimalist design that doesn’t feel overly crowded, even during the busy lunch hours. I was there around peak time, and while the place was lively, it maintained a sense of order and calm. Whether you’re grabbing something quickly for takeaway or dining in, the layout makes it easy to enjoy your meal without feeling rushed or cramped. What’s even more impressive is the level of service. The staff at Earl Canteen were incredible from start to finish 🙌. They greeted me with a warm smile as soon as I walked in, and despite the midday rush, they were efficient and organized. It’s not easy to maintain such a level of customer service when the place is packed, but they did it with ease. I also appreciated how they took the time to explain a couple of items on the menu when I asked for recommendations. You can tell that the staff are well-trained and genuinely care about giving customers a great experience. Another aspect that sets Earl Canteen apart is how accessible and convenient the location is. Being situated on 45 Collins St. makes it ideal for anyone working in the area or just passing through. It’s the perfect spot for a quick lunch during the workday, but also versatile enough for a more leisurely meal if you have the time 🗺️. Whether you’re a local or a visitor to the city, the ease of access and high standard of food make it a must-visit. One thing I truly appreciated was how they’ve managed to create such an inviting space without losing efficiency. The staff handled the lunch rush smoothly, and I never felt like I was waiting too long for my order. It’s one of those places where you can count on the service being just as good as the food, and that’s a rare combination. Overall, Earl Canteen has quickly become one of my favorite lunch spots in the city. From the food to the service to the atmosphere, every detail has been carefully thought out, ensuring an exceptional dining experience. If you’re a fan of fresh, wholesome meals that don’t compromise on flavor, Earl Canteen is definitely worth a visit. I’ll definitely be back soon to try out more of their menu options and to relive this wonderful experience! 👏🍴 | Food is great, delicious.

Great experience! | Robata ticks most of the usual boxes for a Melbourne CBD restaurant: fancy interior design, solid wine list and well trained staff with some banter at the ready. Food was a bit of a let down with most dishes fairly average, one good (the tsukune, aka chicken meatball) and one seafood item not fresh. Nothing exceptional apart from one of the sakés.

ChIJAd2WxERD1moRpTOJg1Vbh58,"‘More Style than Substance’ Whilst the restaurants interior is undeniably lavish, the food itself falls short of expectations. All dishes were plated well but lacked substance. The steep prices are rivalled only by the sluggish service. Ordered - 1 starter, 1 main, 2 desserts and 4 cocktails. Priced at $265. | We walked over from The Edge after a show, drawn by the elegant setting and the name, which means cardamom in Gujarati. But just to clarify — this is not Gujarati cuisine. The menu focuses on broader Indian dishes with a modern presentation. We ordered a chaat appetizer, daal, subzi, naan, and two drinks (one non-alcoholic). The food was okay — spicier than I expected, and the chaat was just OK. Drinks were small for the price, especially the non-alcoholic one, which was priced almost like a cocktail.

ChIJd5o3LLhD1moRqyrZNfl78F4,"Bar Bambi – A Memorable Saturday Night Experience We visited Bar Bambi on a bustling Saturday night and were absolutely impressed by the experience. From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was vibrant yet intimate – perfect for a weekend night out with mates. The food was a definite highlight. We enjoyed a delicious spread including the Spanner Crab Linguine, Chicken Main, Calamari, and Pork Sausage Pasta – each dish was beautifully presented, flavorful, and sumptuous. The kitchen delivered on quality and taste. To accompany our meal, we selected a stunning bottle of Nebbiolo, along with a few well-crafted cocktails – all of which added to the indulgence of the evening. A special mention goes to our waitress, Tilly, who provided warm, attentive, and professional service throughout the night. She helped elevate the experience with her friendly demeanor. Bar Bambi is a fantastic spot for a stylish night out, whether you're dining, drinking, dancing or just soaking up the ambiance. Highly recommend! | The first time my friends and I went here, two of our party had our drinks forgotten. When they finally got it to us we were informed we only had a short time left in our seating left to finish it. We asked if we could move to the bar instead as we did not want to rush down our cocktails and wanted to enjoy it, especially as it wasn't our fault it was forgotten. They said we couldn't and offered no alternatives, which is pretty poor customer service. The food was fine, but nothing special for higher priced Italian food. You are paying for the atmosphere. The second time we went was a fortnight ago, and the bar area was crowded. I was pushed by the waitress as she was making her way through to deliver drinks/food. I thought it was a one off but then later on throughout the night my friends mentioned it was happening to them too. That's incredibly rude. An ""excuse me"" would go a long way. It's absolutely not the first time I've been on a busy bar or club, and other places manage to find staff who don't just push people out of the way like cattle.

This is absolutely my favourite restaurant and wine bar in the city right now and I think a big part of that is due to the team. Cannot recommend highly enough! Thank you again Yuhan, Vanessa, Richard and the Vine Smith team. | What a lovely restaurant in every respect. Everything works here in lovely harmony - the food, the space and the service. Our friends and us thoroughly enjoyed our meals here. The two amuse bouche to start were absolutely delicious and a lot of fun. Every dish in my meal was excellent too. A beautiful duck terrine as entree, succulent rack of lamb for main and a delicious poached pear for dessert. Every dish was beautifully presented - they looked wonderful - and were feasts for their eyes. They have a nice wine list here and we chose a couple of lovely local bottles from Blue Pyrenees. We were most struck by how beautifully presented the restaurant is. This is how to do a restaurant renovation! The place is very stylish outside and inside. It’s superbly designed and really lovely to dine in. We were lucky enough to get a table by the window and had a delightful view of the life in Spring Street and the gorgeous park across the road.

Watching the raw salmon and egg slowly cook on the plate was part of the fun. I mixed everything together quickly while it was still sizzling—the heat cooked it just right.

Unfortunately not always cooked to perfection (I’ve attended twice and found the steak was over cooked and the barramundi was undercooked) but they are learning so I guess it’s understandable. The Chicken parma has been my favourite so far - well cooked, flavourful and good sized portion. As for the dessert - the chocolate tart is exceptional, my only criticism is that they should provide a knife and fork to eat it as the tart shell is impossible to cut with a spoon! The toffee icecream it is served with is absolutely delicious. My friend and I both ordered the tart dessert but our portions of icecream was hugely different - possibly because they were prepared and served to the table, about 5 minutes apart. I would recommend serving all meals in a course at the same time, so this issue would’ve been noticed. All in all, it is not exceptional but good value for a basic, filling lunch.

They offered 10% off everything plus free spring rolls, and those spring rolls were delicious, packed with shrimp and other tasty fillings. As a Vietnamese person, I’m usually very picky about pho.

The shop glows with pink signage and a wall of illustrated menus, so you can scope out your order before reaching the counter.

The menu leans Taiwanese, offering chewy taro balls over silky tofu pudding, grass jelly with red beans, and shaved ice piled high with fresh mango when it is in season. Portion sizes are generous and built for sharing. My go-to mix is the warm ginger syrup bowl topped with sweet potato balls that stay springy to the last spoonful. Drinks cover the bubble-tea basics, with brown sugar milk tea landing rich and perfectly balanced, boba still warm from the pot. Staff keep the line moving with brisk efficiency, calling orders by number and offering containers if you decide to take dessert on the run. Prices sit in that sweet spot between university-budget friendly and dessert-bar indulgent, so trying a couple of different toppings does not sting the wallet.

ChIJHVs9FllD1moRM0817WiLGzo,"Visited for the weekend high tea which included a three tier stand, scones, and a buffet of desserts, cheese selection, chocolate fountain and mini sausage rolls and pies. The three tier stand took about 20 minutes to prepare so it was nice to be able to start with some hot food from the buffet section. From the three tier stand, the cucumber and cream cheese finger sandwich was one of the better ones I had; the smoked salmon and cream cheese cannoli was the best one out of the savouries, and the pistachio tart and the cappuccino entremet were both decadent and very tasty. The scone service came midway into high tea so you can enjoy them warm, and they came back later with another round which was nice but I decided to reserve some space to try some of the desserts from the buffet. Surprisingly the quality of the sweets from the buffet were just as good as the ones from the high tea menu, especially the pineapple tart, citrus pavlova and the earl grey & bergamot slice. Drinks were extensive with a glass of sparkling wine included, and free flow coffee, hot chocolate and twelve types of loose leaf teas to choose from. Teas were high quality; had the Windsor's Afternoon Blend which has a deep well-rounded flavour without the harsh bitterness, and the Lapsang Souchong which has an intense but pleasant smoky aroma. Overall enjoyed the high tea experience, especially the desserts and teas; atmosphere was classy and elegant and the staffs were professional and welcoming though it was a little difficult to order drinks but understandable because of how busy it was. The additional $20 for the weekend high tea which includes the buffet was definitely worth it if you have a big appetite. | Great staff and atmosphere. Attended high tea for a seminar. They were able to adapt the food to my allergies. The tea selection was amazing. Has windsor arvo tea, Lapsang soucheong and Berry green.

The menu had a great variety: fried dishes, chicken, rice, and more. The portions were generous, and the prices were very affordable for the amount and quality of food we received. We even ordered extra to take away because we enjoyed it so much. One interesting cultural detail for me was that the rice was served without salt. In my Colombian culture, we usually season our rice, so at first it felt a bit unusual. But in the end, it actually worked really well with the rest of the dish—it balanced the flavors nicely and wasn’t unpleasant at all.

Our biggest and most sincere thank you goes to Serena the wedding coordinator on site. We’re stuck for words on her commitment and professionalism to her job. She’s relaxed, friendly, responded to a million emails (and quickly!), she accommodated every query, question and request we had. No ask was too great (within reason of venue management ofcourse). On the day, Serena was on to every small and large detail. Our family and bridal party thought she was the bees knees - as did we. A reflection of her work, not a single thing went wrong on the day.

ChIJTQxR9jJd1moRhc72ZLF-Lvk,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I recently visited Arabesque Restaurant & Lounge and only tried the food, and I must say—it was outstanding. The flavors were incredibly authentic, with every dish tasting homemade and true to Middle Eastern tradition. The seasoning, freshness, and presentation showed real attention to detail. The menu offered a wide variety, and everything we ordered was both delicious and satisfying. It’s rare to find a place where the food alone can create such a memorable experience, but Arabesque delivers exactly that. If you’re looking for genuine, flavorful, and authentic cuisine, this is the spot. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates quality food. | If you’re after big portions and rich, hearty meals, this place delivers. The food is delicious and leans toward the heavier, fattier side of Arabian-style cuisine. However, if you’re looking for more than just a good feed — such as a pleasant dining atmosphere — this might not be the spot. The dining area is quite dark and gloomy, with no real sense of an Arabian ambience or décor to match the food style. Also worth noting: no alcoholic drinks are served or allowed here.",restaurant_english_clean_desc

Then we ordered fried seafood platter which was lovely cooked to perfection so fresh not to much batter chips where the best. Seafood is really cheap the platter is huge and only $30 😃 would highly recommend this place to anyone. I will be definitely going back again soon. | We stopped by Saltwater Sushi and Oyster Bar at Queen Vic Market and were impressed by the friendly staff and the appealing selection of sushi, sashimi, and seafood. The display was vibrant, and everything looked fresh and inviting. We decided to try the lobster roll, one of their signature items. While the presentation was great, the roll itself was cold in the center, suggesting it had been frozen and wasn’t thoroughly warmed through. That really took away from the experience, as we were expecting something freshly prepared. It was also overloaded with onion - honestly, I’ve never had onion in a lobster roll before, and it was overpowering and kind of gross. That said, we still appreciated the wide variety of seafood on offer and the courteous service. They also had a wide selection of drinks. With a bit more attention to preparation and more balanced ingredients - especially for the lobster roll - this place could easily become a go-to for seafood lovers, unfortunately right now it feels like a waste of money.",restaurant_english_clean_desc
ChIJD-wAZTNd1moRWOPU5Ada0kw,The fish laksa was good. There are a lot of condiments to customise your food to your liking. The food came out fast. Price is alright for the portion. I wish they would let you choose the type of noodles you want. I'd like the egg noodle than the rice one. | They are super busy on Saturdays. This was hands down the best beef rendang I have tried in Melbourne - got it with the nasi lemak which was soooo fragrant & coconutty 😍 The serving size was also massive.

ChIJmdDrfTNd1moR3lL-_mUgSgI,"Went for dinner on Saturday night. This place exceeded our expectations. We were expecting great food and they definitely delivered. We decided to have the Paella de Mariscos, and given it takes ~30mins, had a few Tapas to start with. We ordered the Oysters with a saffron granita, croquetas de jamon, and the special, salted cod croquetas. All three tapas were awesome. We also received an additional (free) tapas - stuffed piquillo peppers. The paella was well worth the wait, perfectly cooked with a great mix of seafood. We finished the meal off with a shared slice of Basque Cheesecake. The wine list is comprehensive, with a great mix of local and international wines. We had a lovely Spanish Tempranillo. The staff were friendly and very attentive. The owner also made a point of chatting with everyone, we chatted to her quite a bit throughout the night. She was lovely. Would definitely recommend this place and will go again when next in Melbourne. | As a professional chef, I approach every dining experience with a critical eye—evaluating technique, flavor, presentation, and attention to detail. This Spanish restaurant delivers a well-balanced offering that combines authentic traditional cuisine with modern touches, executed with care and precision. We started with the croquettes, which were outstanding: perfectly crisp on the outside, with a creamy, well-emulsified filling and a refined, lasting flavor. A clear example of quality ingredients and classic technique done right. The omelet was another highlight. A simple dish, but one that requires skill. It was cooked to perfection—soft and juicy in the center, with a generous amount of melted cheese that added richness without overpowering. A dish that shows respect for both the product and the guest. The cheesecake is a must for those with a sweet tooth—rich, smooth, and indulgently sweet, with a well-balanced base that brings the dessert together beautifully. We finished with a deep, flavorful coffee and a fresh orange juice that tasted just like homemade—natural and refreshing. Beyond the food, the service was truly exceptional: warm, knowledgeable, and genuinely attentive. The restaurant also offers a wide range of price points, making it accessible for different budgets without compromising quality. In summary: A place where Spanish culinary tradition is respected, professional techniques are well applied, and the overall experience is both satisfying and memorable. Highly recommended for anyone seeking honest, flavorful cuisine—especially fellow hospitality professionals.",restaurant_english_clean_desc

ChIJu8BTxSVo1moREmTgfdGpHsY,"Best mussels i've ever had, so tender fresh and flavourful! Have to order the chilli coconut cream mussels, not too spicy for non spice eaters and the sauce really elevated the mussels. I would not recommend the white wine cream mussels as the taste of the white wine is way too strong and it threw us off (though the chef was kind enough to recook it with more cream for us, appreciate it) Definitely will come back again for other flavours! | After visiting three times over the past few years to indulge in my favorite mussels, I’m happy to say the quality has remained consistently excellent. I first discovered this gem back in November 2021, right after the pandemic, tucked into a cozy corner of Queen Victoria Market. It’s a charming setup — almost like a street-style pull cart where the mussels are cooked fresh. Though there’s usually a short queue, the wait is only about 5–10 minutes. Seating is self-service, so it’s best to come with a friend — one can grab a table while the other queues for food. The menu offers several sauce options, and after trying most of them, I’d say the white wine version is my top pick — it brings out the natural flavor of the mussels beautifully. It is plump and juicy. The cheese option comes next, though it can be a bit rich. The spicy coconut cream base is perfect if you’re in the mood for something with an Asian twist. I found the red wine and chili base to be just average, while the steamed mussels were decent as well. The familiar auntie who was there only last 2 visits were not there today. Each pot is priced between $14–$19 and comes with one or two slices of bread. It’s a simple yet satisfying experience, especially if you grab a drink from one of the nearby stalls to enjoy alongside your mussels. Always a pleasure coming back here!",restaurant_english_clean_desc
ChIJc3_aT6dd1moRcN1d0K045Yw,"Lovely sandwich place to get Burgers, Chicken skewers, Burek’s, drinks. Service is prompt and prices reasonable.

The only other thing I’d say is the cutlery wasn’t really suited for cutting things well, but I’d definitely recommend and will be coming back. | Cafe Victoria offers a cozy and satisfying brunch experience. The bagel sandwich is fresh and well-balanced with greens and salmon, while the open-faced toast topped with pickled onions and rocket is both vibrant and flavorful. Their coffee—served with nice latte art and a touch of chocolate dust—is smooth and aromatic, making it a perfect pairing.

ChIJ7wzUC0Fd1moRKHQMuSV3kVI,"Update your damn business hours! It's never accurate! Anyway their Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup is similar to Master Lanzhou, no numbing effect if you know you know. Good price but you won't get as much meat compared to the other Lanzhou Noodle shops nearby. Also you cannot choose Noodle sizes. | I ordered the braised beef brisket noodle and it was so good. It was a mildly cold night in Melbourne and it was so satisfying to eat a bowl of noodles at this small joint, away from the busy area of the CBD. There were probably about 10-15 tables in the restaurant so there are plenty of spaces to sit when we got there. The cold dishes were pretty good as well. A combo set was what I ordered and I was more than full after everything was finished. Service wasnt bad either. From where we sat, we could see the kitchen.

ChIJZZzb6nNd1moRit6qgym4yPA,"Made a reservation for dinner on a weekday and had the tori tendon with some extra tempuras. Ordered via the QR code on the table and the food took around 15 minutes to arrive. The portion was decent for the price. Most of the tempura pieces were light and crispy, the soft boil egg was perfectly cooked with a creamy yolk, and the sweet tendon sauce goes well together with the tempura and rice. The only thing I didn't enjoy as much was the vegetable kakiage which either has a different batter or was overcooked; too crunchy and heavy. | I was happy to find that there was a Japanese restaurant that specialised in tempura so I had to give it a try. We came around 6pm on Wednesday and we had to wait for about 5 minutes. The tempura was good but the sauce was a bit too little even though they allowed you to ask for more if needed. The extra which I requested arrived even in a smaller plate. If they could give an option in the online ordering to request how much sauce we wanted, that would have been better. The tempura was crispy on the outside and still soft inside. The matcha drink was ok. Overall, I had a good experience at this place.",restaurant_english_clean_desc
ChIJj_q4u89d1moRHP97EfP5VLU,"4.5! During weekends it’s busy, but we managed to sit outside after waiting for ~5min. Had Onigiri set which was a perfect brunch. Onigiri was simple but really good, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. I recommend if you are craving light, healthy dish! We also had kinako matcha and lavender matcha - both very delicious and would def get them again. | Went for a quick bite for breakfast at Operator San, and left very satisfied. The atmosphere is cosy and inviting—perfect for coffee dates and catching up with friends, but could have the potential to feel slightly crowded and claustrophobic when going at peak hours. It also seems to be very welcoming to families and children. Observing the service, we found that most of the staff members seemed extremely friendly, except for the girl who was serving us, but it was honestly nothing major—we appreciate her for serving us!! We went at around 9:00am and did not have to wait long for food and drink. Onigiri Set — 8/10 The shiitake flavoured onigiri was the star for me. It was so packed full of the shiitake flavour—sooo delicious. Salmon cooked to perfection, juicy and flaky. Overall, a very balanced dish—sweet tamago contrasts both the savoury onigiri and miso soup while the pickles undercut the fattiness of the salmon. It is on the pricier side but definitely worth trying. Lavender Matcha — 9/10 The taste of the lavender worked so incredibly beautifully with the matcha. Sweetness was just right, very smooth, creamy and addictive. Only downside is that you get less than what you usually would with a standard matcha latte at $10. Highly recommend! Matcha Kinako — 7.5/10 Again, sweetness was just right and the kinako worked well with the matcha. No strong notes of coconut from the coconut foam which I did not mind, as the kinako flavour here is the true star of the show. Slightly less smooth due to the kinako itself but would highly suggest for those who are DF to try!",restaurant_english_clean_desc

Morta was our favourite but I'm still thinking about the sandwiches having finished them earlier today. Will be back to try the weekend porchetta sandwich and pizza | I tried the turkey, brie and cranberry focaccia sandwich and it was amazing. There was a generous amount of turkey, the bread was crispy yet fluffy and not too heavy. The cranberry paired perfectly with the cheese too.

ChIJm8e-QD1d1moRBU7gF3tr-LU,"Majesty coffee has a a nice atmosphere, probably best suited for smaller groups. The service was nice, very sweet and friendly. Strawberry cloud — 5.5/10 For a whopping $16 you get really cute presentation but a matcha that unfortunately does not meet the standards for both taste and amount. The matcha flavour was lacklustre, the overpowering strawberry flavour morphing the drink into something more like strawberry milk. Berry Nice Latte (w/ soy milk)— 4/10 At $14 this coffee is much more expensive compared to a standard coffee. Again, unfortunately the taste did not live up to a $14 coffee standard. The crushed dehydrated berries on top were a nice addition, but the coffee itself was way waaaay too sweet. The more I drank the sweeter it got. The coffee is missing the berry element, the caramel syrup is much more prominent. I would highly recommend that Majesty coffee try to make the strawberry cloud and berry nice latte much less sweet! Other than that, the presentation was indeed very lovely 😊 | As a professional chef, I'm always on the lookout for places that put care and technique into what they do, and St. Ali was a pleasant surprise. You won’t find an overwhelming menu or pretentious presentations here — but everything you order is well-executed, with quality and great flavor. The atmosphere is super relaxed and cozy, perfect for enjoying a coffee, chatting with someone, or just taking a break from your day. It feels warm, welcoming, and unhurried — like a little pocket of calm. The service was excellent — fast, friendly, and professional. It's always a pleasure to be welcomed with a smile and served efficiently. The savory food was the highlight. I had a ham and cheese croissant that was absolutely amazing — flaky, buttery, and perfectly baked. We also tried a Cuban-style bagel, which was full of flavor and had great texture. The menu is short but carefully curated: croissants, bagels, baguettes... simple things, but done really well. The coffee was great, and while the chai latte didn’t really stand out, it wasn’t bad either. The strength of the place is definitely in its savory offerings and the way they pair bread and fillings to create something simple but memorable. In short, St. Ali isn’t trying to do everything — just doing a few things really well, and you can tell. If you love enjoying a great croissant with a quality coffee in a relaxed and welcoming setting, this is definitely a place worth visiting. ✨ Highly recommended if you appreciate quality, friendly service, and well-executed flavors.",restaurant_english_clean_desc

We tried a few types of kottu, some hoppers, and the deviled chicken. Everything was full of flavor and well-balanced. The chili oil that came with the deviled chicken was especially spicy and taste really good. Just a heads-up, if you ask for your food spicy, they take it seriously.

ChIJcfj-DShD1moRYDXgZCwF3Ig,"🥤🍋 I recently visited Machi Machi on La Trobe Street and decided to try their Lemon Yogurt Mousse Iced Tea. I have to say, it was an absolutely delightful experience. From the moment I took my first sip, I was hit with a refreshing blend of flavors that felt perfectly balanced. The iced tea itself was just the right level of sweetness, with the lemon providing a zesty, citrusy kick that was both invigorating and palate-cleansing. It’s one of those drinks that feels like it was tailor-made for a hot day, offering a cool and crisp taste that quenches your thirst almost immediately. What surprised me the most was how fresh and natural the lemon flavor tasted; it wasn’t artificial at all, which is something I really appreciate in a beverage. I ordered the standard size ($8.50) with normal sugar. 🍦🥄 Now, let’s talk about the star of the show—the yogurt mousse layer on top. This was an absolute game-changer! The mousse was incredibly light and fluffy, almost like a whipped cream but with a distinct, tangy yogurt taste that added a creamy dimension to the drink. It was slightly sweet but had a tartness that perfectly complemented the underlying lemon tea. The combination of the tangy mousse and the sweet-tart lemon tea was a match made in heaven. I found myself savoring each sip, trying to get just the right balance of mousse and tea in every mouthful. The way the mousse slowly mixed into the tea as you drank it was a delightful visual treat, creating this beautiful swirling pattern that made the drink look as good as it tasted. It’s the kind of unique twist that makes Machi Machi’s drinks stand out from the typical bubble tea shops. The texture was another highlight for me. The contrast between the smooth, creamy mousse and the light, refreshing tea was spot on. As the mousse started to melt into the tea, it gave the drink a velvety mouthfeel that I found incredibly satisfying. It almost felt like you were drinking a dessert, making it a perfect option if you’re craving something sweet but not overly indulgent. The drink was well-crafted, with a perfect balance between the tea’s natural bitterness, the lemon’s tartness, and the yogurt’s creamy texture. I also appreciated the quality of the ingredients used—the tea had a rich, full-bodied flavor, and the lemon didn’t taste artificial or overly sour. You could tell a lot of thought and care went into crafting this drink, making it a standout option on their menu. 🏡💁‍♀️ The ambiance of Machi Machi itself was another pleasant surprise. The shop has a bright, welcoming vibe with a modern aesthetic that’s both clean and inviting. It’s the kind of place where you could easily take it to go and continue to your work. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. 🥳💯 Overall, I highly recommend trying the Lemon Yogurt Mousse Iced Tea at Machi Machi if you’re looking for something different and refreshing. It’s a unique twist on the typical iced tea, combining the tartness of lemon with the creamy tang of yogurt mousse, resulting in a well-balanced, delicious drink. The experience was memorable, and it’s one of those drinks that I’ll definitely be coming back for, especially on a warm day. It’s a must-try for anyone who enjoys creative and thoughtfully crafted beverages. Machi Machi has definitely earned a new regular customer in me, and I can’t wait to explore more of their menu offerings in the future! | One of my all time favorite bubble tea place for years especially the bottle drink series.

I ordered a taro milk tea, and massively disappointed. It's just powder stuff, no pearls included so pretty expensive for what it is. Do yourself a favour and avoid: Plenty of other bubble tea options in the city. Only positive is the friendly lady manning the shop. | went here after work for a cold drink and was very satisfied. ordered a kiwi green tea after inquiring about a fruit crush. kiwi green tea was very refreshing and didn't have that overzealous sugary-syrup taste that most franchises have. i think this is due to this place using real fruit in their drinks! when i inquired about their crushes, they had a limited range of flavors available which i believe was because this was at 5:30pm on a weekday and they had used up some of their supply. if this is the case, come early if you want a particular fruit that's on their menu. after being given my drink i was given a box with coconut mango chips(?) and chocolate chips (for free) asking me to write this review, which I was happy to do and probably would have done anyway. $6.30 kiwi green tea comes with black pearls and light ice the nail service was a bit had to figure out and the lighting in the shop was a bit dull, but the customer service was top tear from the food section. very polite and made sure i knew what was in the drink so I didn't accidentally order extra pearls. nail salon services is not readily posted around the shop (that i could see for the short time I was there and looked around) but the cashier was happy to point me towards the door where the booking QR code is (which I have attached). overall, i will be returning when i need a nice drink in a pinch. i recommend a little dusting, adding warm/colorful lights in the front room, and adding clear signage or a price list for the salon services.",milktea_juice_english_clean

Highly recommend trying Milksha out if you haven’t already! You’ll definitely find something that will satisfy your bubble tea craving! | On August 4th at afternoon I had a very disappointing experience with one of your female staff members. Her tone, facial expression, and overall attitude were extremely unwelcoming as if she was angry before I even walked in. I had never met her before, and I had just entered the shop politely. I understand that people can have tough days, but that doesn’t excuse poor service especially in hospitality. Many other workers out there handle pressure professionally and kindly. I truly believe there are many people who could represent your brand much better. Your drinks are genuinely delicious but sadly, this staff member’s attitude significantly affected the overall experience. Even other customers around me seemed uncomfortable. If she’s willing to improve, I fully support growth.But if she believes her current behavior is acceptable, perhaps this role isn’t a good fit for her.

ChIJDdS3Cw9D1moReazUfvsAPwU,"I've ordered from this new bubble tea store via Hungry Panda three times and tried four different milk teas. Honestly, it's one of the best brands I've tried lately. My favourite is the OG Pearls Milk. It hits the perfect balance of black tea, milk, and pearls. Its taste brings me back to the classic milk tea I had years ago in Taiwan. I guess that’s why it’s called OG– it really nails that original flavour. Coming in second is the Amber Whisper Roasted Oolong. The A2 milk used here pairs beautifully with the oolong, not too strong in taste, but the rich aroma of roasted oolong is still very present and smooth. Third place for me is the Ripe Black Pearls. It’s decent, but since it shares the same black tea base as OG Pearls Milk, I didn’t find it as memorable. Still a nice option if you’re into classic black milk teas. My least favourite was the Spring Moss Green. I know green tea is generally light but the green tea favour in this drink was a bit too light and the A2 milk overpowered the tea. That said, it might still suit those who prefer a milder taste or want something light before bed. Overall, this place delivers good milk teas with high quality ingredients. With so many bubble tea options in Melbourne CBD, I genuinely think this store deserves more attention. | Ordered a taro milk tea, and it’s not bad. Has seating place to enjoy your tea.

The Thai Tea Bingsu could’ve been a bit sweeter for my taste, but the Mango Sticky Rice one was really unique and flavorful. The Pandan & Coconut Shokupan was the highlight—so soft and delicious! The portion sizes are a bit smaller compared to other Bingsu places I’ve been to, so keep that in mind. Also, the space is quite small and seating is tight, so it might not be ideal for big groups. Still, if you’re a dessert lover, it’s definitely worth a visit! | If you’re looking for the perfect sweet treat after a meal, this is definitely the place to be! Their desserts are not only delicious but also perfect for sharing with a couple of friends. I came here with a few mates after dinner and we decided to try their famous bingsu.

The mango was fresh, sweet, and juicy, the sticky rice had the perfect chewy texture, and the creamy shaved ice just tied everything together beautifully. Every bite felt refreshing yet satisfying, not overly sweet, just right. It’s the kind of dessert that makes you want to slow down and enjoy every spoonful. We couldn’t stop talking about how good it was, and by the time we finished, the bowl was completely clean. If you’re a fan of mango, you’ll love it, but even if you’re not, I think it’s still worth giving it a try because the balance of flavors is just spot on.

ChIJBaUBTrRC1moRNdF-YqUyESg,"Let’s begin with the basics, this place doesn’t seem to understand the difference between high tea and afternoon tea, which is unfortunately all too common in Australia. It would be worth brushing up on the definitions before making bold claims. If you’re someone who values the authenticity of British traditions, consider yourself warned. The venue itself is tiny, truly difficult to find, and sadly, any sense of elegance or refinement is lost the moment you step inside. A handful of tables were occupied, none of them particularly clean, and the overall atmosphere was one of a place in decline. It feels poorly maintained, with no effort made to live up to the sophistication typically associated with a proper afternoon tea experience. To their credit, there is a decent tea selection. Thank you for that. However, the dessert offering was minimal, and what was there looked rather tired and uninviting.

ChIJdwMOWABD1moR3RhVGOlHqD8,"In Short : Camellia (茶花女） in Melbourne is a standout hand-crafted tea brand, focusing on pure, tea-forward flavors without toppings. Its teas are aromatic, layered, and distinctly tea-driven, on par with Charlie’s Tea in the CBD. The beautifully designed cups add an artistic touch that elevates the overall experience. Detail : Recently, I visited Camellia, a hand-crafted tea brand in Melbourne recommended by a friend. Its branding and tea-forward profile immediately reminded me of China’s well-known chain CHAGEE, which also highlights rich tea bases and a clean, lingering finish. Unlike many bubble tea shops, Camellia does not offer add-on toppings, focusing instead on the purity of its teas and milk teas. This approach allows the tea’s aroma and body to stand out more distinctly, showcasing the quality of the leaves themselves. In terms of taste, the tea is clear, layered, and distinctly aromatic — a strong tea-driven style. Overall, I would place Camellia alongside Charlie’s Tea as one of the standout hand-crafted tea brands in Melbourne’s CBD. The visual design also deserves mention: its cups are exceptionally well-designed, with an artistic aesthetic that enhances the overall customer experience and reinforces the brand’s unique identity. | I stopped by Camellia for their signature milk tea and it instantly became a new favorite.

She started with a warm and simple greeting, and when she noticed that we were seriously browsing and trying to find teas we liked, she kindly asked if it was our first time and whether we needed help.

Also I see that the black pearl was very mushy and I can swallow them easily. After all, I feel very disappointed | Love this place! Stopped by here whilst enjoying a walk around the city recently and ordered the Lychee Jasmine Green Tea. Absolutely delicious and sooooo refreshing! The staff member was really helpful and friendly and happily answered any questions I had. Will definitely be stopping by again next time I’m in the area!!",milktea_juice_english_clean

ChIJu1ZA-pFd1moRyicJp5ZXye8,"I love cream cheese awwww. The staff girls are very cute, polite. The flavor is nice, but I’d enjoy it more if the tea taste was stronger 🩷 | The jasmine milk tea with pistachio cream is really delicious, with a fragrant, slightly sweet, and creamy flavor, complemented by a strong tea taste. The service here is also good. A wonderful experience!",milktea_juice_english_clean
ChIJrwOG2LND1moRAB1nk1dgwMA,"TLDR: stands out, good tea flavour, fast service, decent location ChaHalo is one of the new tea-focused Chinese milk tea shops in Melbourne similar to CHAGEE, Molly Tea, Tea White, Top Tea, etc. They use A2 milk as the creamer like Molly and have had perfect consistency for me so far. The brand is originally from Xi’An, China— it’s not homegrown like Top Tea. I’ve tried almost all their milk teas and can say they are of good quality and can stand out from the rest of the shops. You can order online as well, the shop is takeout only— no seating, but the outside concrete planter isn’t too bad to have a seat for a bit. It’s never too busy so it’s really good if you don’t want to wait >30 minutes for another shop. The price point is the same as other shops ($7.80) ~$7.92 after card surcharge. It’s nearby RMIT and a short walk from Melbourne Central. Their Signature Jasmine Milk Tea is as good (maybe better) than Molly Tea. Dark Milk Tea is probably the most unique from the shop as it is flavoured with sea salt. My ranking: 1. Jasmine / Dark Milk Tea 2. Osmanthus Oolong / Longjing 3. Rock Oolong / Grape Oolong 4. Orchid Scented / Extra Matcha | Got my order very fast. Pretty authentic Chinese milk tea place but I don’t think I like Oolong tea or smth. Next time will try a different tea base.",milktea_juice_english_clean
ChIJQyyoMpVD1moRKWwZuNy_m6g,"My new favorite dessert spot! Honestly didn’t expect it to be this good. I tried the Chimnutz with matcha and the sweetness was just perfect. The chimney cake was delicious too. crispy, soft, and so satisfying. The place is clean, and the service is really good. Definitely a must-try! If u are looking for a dessert spot in cbd, I highly recommend this place | Finally got to try Chimnutz in Melbourne CBD and it did not disappoint! The chimnuts are freshly made with warm, fluffy dough that’s so light but still satisfying. The fillings are generous, and the mix of flavors really hit the spot – super fun dessert that feels a bit different from the usual. The staff were lovely and the place had such a cozy vibe too. Definitely recommend dropping by if you’re in the city and craving a sweet treat!",milktea_juice_english_clean

ChIJtUIS8c5C1moRMhwSsUaAxzg,"🛍🛒 A decent IGA store on Exhibition St. that sells a variety of items such as snacks, soft and hard drinks, frizen food, vegetables, etc. I wasn't expecting it to be as big as it is, and all the items in store. One can get some common items quickly from this store in the city, at correct prices. Plus, the staff was friendly, so that's a good thing. 👍🏽🙂 Overall, if you can manage your expectations and are looking to buy some quick stuff in the city, this place wouldn't disappoint. | The cashier was extremely rude, didn’t respond properly, and was aggressively tossing the items I was buying.

The rude older lady in Queen Victoria Market store has no customer service skills whatsoever. This establishment is loosing a long time customer, and unfortunately I can't recommend their food any longer. | Plenty of Borek and Golzeme to choose from, $6 each for a Borek is great value, you can add a fresh juice deal for $13.

ChIJYb_LZKFD1moR7jLuYnSVuJo,"Visited to try the fluffy jiggly pancakes at Kumo Desserts. We went for pistachio papi and strawberry skies with whipped cream, and they were divine! The pistachio one was sweet, nutty, and rich in flavour, while the portion size was generous and filling. We paired them with an iced Thai lime tea and a mandarin yuzu light, tangy, and super refreshing for a sunny day. They also offer a lovely range of other hot and cold drinks. Service was friendly and accommodating. If you’re keen on souvenirs, you can even grab a plush pancake to take home, such a cute touch! Definitely worth a visit for dessert lovers. Excited to try a pandan pancake next time! 💚✨ | If you are asking yourself “Is it even that good?”, trust me it is THAT GOOD! I was doubtful too and was just accompany friends on a full stomach, but I polished the whole plate and wanted more! It’s now one of my favourite dessert in the city, the biscoff crumbs and the vanilla gelato combo is just out of this world!!
