Each dish was exquisite, tender, and seasoned just right. The happy hour was also a highlight with a great selection of beers, wines, and cocktails — something for everyone. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the service was friendly and attentive throughout the evening. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a satisfying meal and a relaxed vibe in the city. We’ll definitely be back! | The foods and drinks are amazing as well as service!!

The place is clearly popular, there were plenty of people seated inside when I was there and plenty ordering takeaway too, even the cafe is not in what you’d call the busiest part of town. I ordered mixed chicken and lamb, sauce on the side, with salad and a few randomly sprinkled jalapeños on top. I have rarely chosen this wisely. The meat was fantastic. Fresh as a daisy and really tender and nicely flavoured. The salad was great too. The dish was so good, I actually went back for a second helping, a very rare thing. It was delicious. These Keto people might be on to something, you know. Service here was brisk and snappy. Pleasant if you showed some interest. I’d expect nothing less. Was that a Turkish or Arab hip hop playlist that was briefly on on house sound system? It was growing on me. Vibe Kebas is a great spot for a quick tasty and cheap meal or snack. It delivers and at very reasonable prices. Highly recommended. | Wow just wow. The guy behind the counter is an absolute legend. Best snack pack in Melbourne. Crispy delicious chips, topped with cheesy goodness then topped with succulent lamb and juicy flavoursome chicken then topped with cheese again and finished with the holy trinity of sauces. BBQ, garlic and chilli. What a sight for sore eyes. This is a work of art was only $15 and it included a can of drink. Can’t get any better than this. Best snack pack in Melbourne I repeat!

I rate this meal and its flavour the best Thai basil chili meal in Melbourne CBD and have recommended it to many people and taken many friends there to enjoy it. The meal includes a fried egg and cost $15.90. In the last few days/weeks, the same meal has increased $1 and no longer includes a fried egg which is now an optional extra at $3. To get the meal that once cost $15.90 is now $19.90. A massive 25% increase. The meal is small to begin with (ideal for me), but my recent experience after the price increase, was disappointing. The vegetables seem to have more inexpensive onion, it had absolutely no Thai basil in it and without the egg, the mound of rice was dry and unenjoyable. Now, at $19.90 for the same small meal with egg is not worth my money for the small portion size. Photos attached are the meal with egg at $15.90 in August 2025 and the meal in September 2025 without egg. You may think its the same, just missing the egg, but there was more changes than that. I accept an increase in meal price, especially with rising costs of ingredients, energy, store rent, staff wages, etc, but to remove the egg from the meal and charge $3 extra for an egg is excessive. Unfortunately I can no longer recommend this store to friends or ""customers"" in my line of work. I will be exploring other Thai stores. Tip for anyone who buys takeaway to eat the next day, watch the cardboard container and rice dont absorb any juices/flavours overnight because this makes the meal somewhat dry the next day. Transfer it to a plate when you get home, tilt it to keep juices away from the rice. | NAM is an incredible asset to your restaurant! Her service and the food are a perfect 1000/10!

The King even has a Mac’n’Cheese croquette inside, so good! Potato Gems are crispy and soft inside. Grabbed a Coke and a Banana Milkshake perfect combo.

This time I had an Italian-inspired dim sim filled with rich beef ragu and parmesan. Crispy on the outside, hearty and flavourful inside — and totally delicious. What I love about Dimmie Den is the creativity: they offer some flavours inspired by different cuisines, like Greek, Mexican, and more — each with its own unique twist on the classic dim sim. I hope they come up with a Japanese-inspired one someday. I’m Japanese, so of course I started dreaming up flavor ideas right away — hehe. Dimmie Den isn’t just a snack stop — it’s a creative, Melbourne-born concept blending local street food with global flavours. Can’t wait to try more! And what makes it even better?The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. 📍Location tip: You’ll find Dimmie Den at Southern Cross Station, right near the ticket gates. If you’re coming from Spencer Street and Bourke Street, just go up the stairs and it’s on your left — super easy to spot. | The best thing i have eaten in Melbourne in a long time!!! Amazing service!

It would be worth brushing up on the definitions before making bold claims. If you’re someone who values the authenticity of British traditions, consider yourself warned. The venue itself is tiny, truly difficult to find, and sadly, any sense of elegance or refinement is lost the moment you step inside. A handful of tables were occupied, none of them particularly clean, and the overall atmosphere was one of a place in decline. It feels poorly maintained, with no effort made to live up to the sophistication typically associated with a proper afternoon tea experience. To their credit, there is a decent tea selection. Thank you for that. However, the dessert offering was minimal, and what was there looked rather tired and uninviting. The staff were friendly and polite, which was a small redeeming feature, but unfortunately not enough to salvage the experience. In short, if you’re up for a bit of a challenge or enjoy novelty over quality, give it a go. Otherwise, you might be better off elsewhere. | The best cup of tea I’ve ever had. Cannot find fault. This place was perfect. So cute, friendly staff, and seeing into the kitchen is a big interesting plus!

I recently had the pleasure of visiting their Collins Street location, and I can confidently say that it exceeded my expectations in every possible way 🌟. 🥪🥖 Let me start with the food, which is the highlight of this gem. I decided to try their Chicken & Hummus Sandwich ($16.50), and it was, without exaggeration, one of the best sandwiches I’ve had in a long time. The chicken was perfectly cooked—juicy and tender—while the hummus provided the right amount of creaminess that balanced the flavors beautifully. What really stood out was the attention to the finer details. You can tell that the ingredients are sourced thoughtfully; every element in the sandwich felt fresh and packed with flavor. Whether it was the crispness of the vegetables or the softness of the bread, each bite felt carefully crafted. Earl Canteen doesn’t just serve “food”; they create a meal that feels nourishing and indulgent at the same time. You can truly taste the difference when the team behind the counter cares about the quality of what they serve. It’s clear that they’ve put a lot of thought into their menu, offering options that cater to a variety of preferences and dietary needs, without sacrificing flavor or creativity 🌿. If the chicken and hummus sandwich is any indication of their other offerings, I can’t wait to come back and explore more of their menu! 🤩🎉 The ambiance of the space also deserves a special mention 🏙️. In the heart of Collins St., Earl Canteen provides a calm and cozy escape from the busy hustle and bustle of the city. The interior is modern yet comfortable, with a minimalist design that doesn’t feel overly crowded, even during the busy lunch hours. I was there around peak time, and while the place was lively, it maintained a sense of order and calm. Whether you’re grabbing something quickly for takeaway or dining in, the layout makes it easy to enjoy your meal without feeling rushed or cramped. What’s even more impressive is the level of service. The staff at Earl Canteen were incredible from start to finish 🙌. They greeted me with a warm smile as soon as I walked in, and despite the midday rush, they were efficient and organized. It’s not easy to maintain such a level of customer service when the place is packed, but they did it with ease. I also appreciated how they took the time to explain a couple of items on the menu when I asked for recommendations. You can tell that the staff are well-trained and genuinely care about giving customers a great experience. Another aspect that sets Earl Canteen apart is how accessible and convenient the location is. Being situated on 45 Collins St. makes it ideal for anyone working in the area or just passing through. It’s the perfect spot for a quick lunch during the workday, but also versatile enough for a more leisurely meal if you have the time 🗺️. Whether you’re a local or a visitor to the city, the ease of access and high standard of food make it a must-visit. One thing I truly appreciated was how they’ve managed to create such an inviting space without losing efficiency. The staff handled the lunch rush smoothly, and I never felt like I was waiting too long for my order. It’s one of those places where you can count on the service being just as good as the food, and that’s a rare combination. Overall, Earl Canteen has quickly become one of my favorite lunch spots in the city. From the food to the service to the atmosphere, every detail has been carefully thought out, ensuring an exceptional dining experience. If you’re a fan of fresh, wholesome meals that don’t compromise on flavor, Earl Canteen is definitely worth a visit. I’ll definitely be back soon to try out more of their menu options and to relive this wonderful experience! 👏🍴 | Food is great, delicious. Recommend However this company really needs to be more conscious of wasteful packaging when catering for office sites. Please use less plastic and bags for corporate catering. I have had a lot of catering deliveries and this company uses more than others.

From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was vibrant yet intimate – perfect for a weekend night out with mates. The food was a definite highlight. We enjoyed a delicious spread including the Spanner Crab Linguine, Chicken Main, Calamari, and Pork Sausage Pasta – each dish was beautifully presented, flavorful, and sumptuous. The kitchen delivered on quality and taste. To accompany our meal, we selected a stunning bottle of Nebbiolo, along with a few well-crafted cocktails – all of which added to the indulgence of the evening. A special mention goes to our waitress, Tilly, who provided warm, attentive, and professional service throughout the night. She helped elevate the experience with her friendly demeanor. Bar Bambi is a fantastic spot for a stylish night out, whether you're dining, drinking, dancing or just soaking up the ambiance. Highly recommend! | The first time my friends and I went here, two of our party had our drinks forgotten. When they finally got it to us we were informed we only had a short time left in our seating left to finish it. We asked if we could move to the bar instead as we did not want to rush down our cocktails and wanted to enjoy it, especially as it wasn't our fault it was forgotten. They said we couldn't and offered no alternatives, which is pretty poor customer service. The food was fine, but nothing special for higher priced Italian food. You are paying for the atmosphere. The second time we went was a fortnight ago, and the bar area was crowded. I was pushed by the waitress as she was making her way through to deliver drinks/food. I thought it was a one off but then later on throughout the night my friends mentioned it was happening to them too. That's incredibly rude. An ""excuse me"" would go a long way. It's absolutely not the first time I've been on a busy bar or club, and other places manage to find staff who don't just push people out of the way like cattle.

Unfortunately not always cooked to perfection (I’ve attended twice and found the steak was over cooked and the barramundi was undercooked) but they are learning so I guess it’s understandable. The Chicken parma has been my favourite so far - well cooked, flavourful and good sized portion. As for the dessert - the chocolate tart is exceptional, my only criticism is that they should provide a knife and fork to eat it as the tart shell is impossible to cut with a spoon! The toffee icecream it is served with is absolutely delicious. My friend and I both ordered the tart dessert but our portions of icecream was hugely different - possibly because they were prepared and served to the table, about 5 minutes apart. I would recommend serving all meals in a course at the same time, so this issue would’ve been noticed. All in all, it is not exceptional but good value for a basic, filling lunch. Highlight is the chicken Parma and chocolate tart! | Affordable, restaurant quality meals at this culinary school.

Lamb, tender with a crown of dukkha spice sitting on smoky eggplant puree or salmon cooked just right with a clear, orange and miso jus.

My favourite desserts are always the traditional grass jelly with various toppings and the mango sago.😋 The price level is quite reasonable. The staffs are nice and welcoming, though they were usually very busy. If you are from HK / PRC, you can probably speak Cantonese or Putonghua for ordering if you like. | Dessert Story is a reliable fix for late-night cravings in the CBD. The shop glows with pink signage and a wall of illustrated menus, so you can scope out your order before reaching the counter. Seating runs along communal benches and small tables tucked by the windows; it fills quickly after dinner hours but turn-over is fast enough that a spot usually opens within minutes. The menu leans Taiwanese, offering chewy taro balls over silky tofu pudding, grass jelly with red beans, and shaved ice piled high with fresh mango when it is in season. Portion sizes are generous and built for sharing. My go-to mix is the warm ginger syrup bowl topped with sweet potato balls that stay springy to the last spoonful. Drinks cover the bubble-tea basics, with brown sugar milk tea landing rich and perfectly balanced, boba still warm from the pot. Staff keep the line moving with brisk efficiency, calling orders by number and offering containers if you decide to take dessert on the run. Prices sit in that sweet spot between university-budget friendly and dessert-bar indulgent, so trying a couple of different toppings does not sting the wallet. The store stays open well past most cafés, making it a handy final stop after a movie or night class. For colourful comfort sweets, quick service, and a menu that encourages repeat visits, Dessert Story holds its place as a city staple.",-37.8121583,144.9668044,(03) 9650 7776,"195 Little Bourke St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",,ChIJxRIPiMlC1moRLSuO5kfDqC0,Other,3000

The three tier stand took about 20 minutes to prepare so it was nice to be able to start with some hot food from the buffet section. From the three tier stand, the cucumber and cream cheese finger sandwich was one of the better ones I had; the smoked salmon and cream cheese cannoli was the best one out of the savouries, and the pistachio tart and the cappuccino entremet were both decadent and very tasty. The scone service came midway into high tea so you can enjoy them warm, and they came back later with another round which was nice but I decided to reserve some space to try some of the desserts from the buffet. Surprisingly the quality of the sweets from the buffet were just as good as the ones from the high tea menu, especially the pineapple tart, citrus pavlova and the earl grey & bergamot slice. Drinks were extensive with a glass of sparkling wine included, and free flow coffee, hot chocolate and twelve types of loose leaf teas to choose from. Teas were high quality; had the Windsor's Afternoon Blend which has a deep well-rounded flavour without the harsh bitterness, and the Lapsang Souchong which has an intense but pleasant smoky aroma. Overall enjoyed the high tea experience, especially the desserts and teas; atmosphere was classy and elegant and the staffs were professional and welcoming though it was a little difficult to order drinks but understandable because of how busy it was. The additional $20 for the weekend high tea which includes the buffet was definitely worth it if you have a big appetite. | Great staff and atmosphere. Attended high tea for a seminar. They were able to adapt the food to my allergies. The tea selection was amazing. Has windsor arvo tea, Lapsang soucheong and Berry green.

Still, the combo was unique and cute, and easy to share! | Takeaway tray of dozen of st helens oysters, packed in one plastic and 2 paper bags. $24 - other shops at $23 or $26. You can choose to consume there too, they have 2 standing tables. Comes with one wedge of lemon.

The scallop truffle rice rolls didn’t really suit my taste; the flavor combination felt a bit odd. The har gow and xiaolongbao weren’t very impressive either as I found their wrappers were kinda thick 🥲 The black bean chicken feet were a bit too soft for my liking, though my friend really enjoyed them. Black bean pork ribs were standard, nothing much to complain. The sweet bean curd lacked the fragrant ginger note although the bean curd itself was smooth & tasty. The mango pudding was a little too sweet for me, but it was very fragrant — probably even better if served chilled! __________ Overall, I think it was better a few years ago. However, considering the limited options for yum cha in the CBD that still serve in the traditional style, this place isn’t too bad. | We were five in total, including my cherished friends and family. We arrived at 5:20 pm and waited a short while before they opened. Even without a reservation, we were able to get a table, which was great.

We would highly recommend anyone looking for a romantic weekend away to head on over and be spoilt. Breakfast was delicious and everyone was polite, kind and helpful. Thank you again. | My partner and I recently got married at Lancemores Lindenderry Estate. We both find it difficult to summarise how positive, attentive and well regarded our experience and our guests experience was at this venue. The entire experience was stress free, the staff from the minute we walked in to view the venue, through the lunches with family and having 40 of our guests stay onsite for the weekend were incredibly friendly and attentive. Our biggest and most sincere thank you goes to Serena the wedding coordinator on site. We’re stuck for words on her commitment and professionalism to her job. She’s relaxed, friendly, responded to a million emails (and quickly!), she accommodated every query, question and request we had. No ask was too great (within reason of venue management ofcourse). On the day, Serena was on to every small and large detail. Our family and bridal party thought she was the bees knees - as did we. A reflection of her work, not a single thing went wrong on the day. Our friends and family are still talking about how wonderful the venue was. Rooms were beautiful. Clean and looked stunning in photos. Food was tasty and to a high standard. Brekky the next day was great. The venue maintenance team and gardener spent days preparing the venue in the lead up - each time we visited they were mowing, pruning etc. it was impeccably presented. The after hours management team once Serena had left for the night were just as great. We couldn’t have been happier with our choice to book Lindenderry for our wedding.

A clear example of quality ingredients and classic technique done right. The omelet was another highlight. A simple dish, but one that requires skill. It was cooked to perfection—soft and juicy in the center, with a generous amount of melted cheese that added richness without overpowering. A dish that shows respect for both the product and the guest. The cheesecake is a must for those with a sweet tooth—rich, smooth, and indulgently sweet, with a well-balanced base that brings the dessert together beautifully. We finished with a deep, flavorful coffee and a fresh orange juice that tasted just like homemade—natural and refreshing. Beyond the food, the service was truly exceptional: warm, knowledgeable, and genuinely attentive. The restaurant also offers a wide range of price points, making it accessible for different budgets without compromising quality.

Have to order the chilli coconut cream mussels, not too spicy for non spice eaters and the sauce really elevated the mussels. I would not recommend the white wine cream mussels as the taste of the white wine is way too strong and it threw us off (though the chef was kind enough to recook it with more cream for us, appreciate it) Definitely will come back again for other flavours! | After visiting three times over the past few years to indulge in my favorite mussels, I’m happy to say the quality has remained consistently excellent. I first discovered this gem back in November 2021, right after the pandemic, tucked into a cozy corner of Queen Victoria Market. It’s a charming setup — almost like a street-style pull cart where the mussels are cooked fresh. Though there’s usually a short queue, the wait is only about 5–10 minutes. Seating is self-service, so it’s best to come with a friend — one can grab a table while the other queues for food. The menu offers several sauce options, and after trying most of them, I’d say the white wine version is my top pick — it brings out the natural flavor of the mussels beautifully. It is plump and juicy. The cheese option comes next, though it can be a bit rich. The spicy coconut cream base is perfect if you’re in the mood for something with an Asian twist. I found the red wine and chili base to be just average, while the steamed mussels were decent as well. The familiar auntie who was there only last 2 visits were not there today. Each pot is priced between $14–$19 and comes with one or two slices of bread. It’s a simple yet satisfying experience, especially if you grab a drink from one of the nearby stalls to enjoy alongside your mussels.

I recommend if you are craving light, healthy dish! We also had kinako matcha and lavender matcha - both very delicious and would def get them again. | Went for a quick bite for breakfast at Operator San, and left very satisfied. The atmosphere is cosy and inviting—perfect for coffee dates and catching up with friends, but could have the potential to feel slightly crowded and claustrophobic when going at peak hours.

Observing the service, we found that most of the staff members seemed extremely friendly, except for the girl who was serving us, but it was honestly nothing major—we appreciate her for serving us!! We went at around 9:00am and did not have to wait long for food and drink. Onigiri Set — 8/10 The shiitake flavoured onigiri was the star for me. It was so packed full of the shiitake flavour—sooo delicious. Salmon cooked to perfection, juicy and flaky. Overall, a very balanced dish—sweet tamago contrasts both the savoury onigiri and miso soup while the pickles undercut the fattiness of the salmon. It is on the pricier side but definitely worth trying. Lavender Matcha — 9/10 The taste of the lavender worked so incredibly beautifully with the matcha. Sweetness was just right, very smooth, creamy and addictive. Only downside is that you get less than what you usually would with a standard matcha latte at $10. Highly recommend! Matcha Kinako — 7.5/10 Again, sweetness was just right and the kinako worked well with the matcha.

There was a generous amount of turkey, the bread was crispy yet fluffy and not too heavy. The cranberry paired perfectly with the cheese too.

The service was nice, very sweet and friendly. Strawberry cloud — 5.5/10 For a whopping $16 you get really cute presentation but a matcha that unfortunately does not meet the standards for both taste and amount. The matcha flavour was lacklustre, the overpowering strawberry flavour morphing the drink into something more like strawberry milk. Berry Nice Latte (w/ soy milk)— 4/10 At $14 this coffee is much more expensive compared to a standard coffee. Again, unfortunately the taste did not live up to a $14 coffee standard. The crushed dehydrated berries on top were a nice addition, but the coffee itself was way waaaay too sweet. The more I drank the sweeter it got. The coffee is missing the berry element, the caramel syrup is much more prominent. I would highly recommend that Majesty coffee try to make the strawberry cloud and berry nice latte much less sweet! Other than that, the presentation was indeed very lovely 😊 | As a professional chef, I'm always on the lookout for places that put care and technique into what they do, and St. Ali was a pleasant surprise. You won’t find an overwhelming menu or pretentious presentations here — but everything you order is well-executed, with quality and great flavor. The atmosphere is super relaxed and cozy, perfect for enjoying a coffee, chatting with someone, or just taking a break from your day. It feels warm, welcoming, and unhurried — like a little pocket of calm. The service was excellent — fast, friendly, and professional. It's always a pleasure to be welcomed with a smile and served efficiently. The savory food was the highlight. I had a ham and cheese croissant that was absolutely amazing — flaky, buttery, and perfectly baked. We also tried a Cuban-style bagel, which was full of flavor and had great texture. The menu is short but carefully curated: croissants, bagels, baguettes... simple things, but done really well. The coffee was great, and while the chai latte didn’t really stand out, it wasn’t bad either. The strength of the place is definitely in its savory offerings and the way they pair bread and fillings to create something simple but memorable. In short, St. Ali isn’t trying to do everything — just doing a few things really well, and you can tell. If you love enjoying a great croissant with a quality coffee in a relaxed and welcoming setting, this is definitely a place worth visiting. ✨ Highly recommended if you appreciate quality, friendly service, and well-executed flavors.",-37.8076207,144.958583,,"1 Dhanga Djeembana Walk, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",https://www.majestycoffee.com.au/,ChIJm8e-QD1d1moRBU7gF3tr-LU,Other,3000

My colleagues Mexican wrap was fresh, eatible but about 15 jalapenoes, with off lettuce and she rated it 2.5 out of 5 The chips like my first review were nothing to write home about, quite cold, unkept and not fresh. We ordered of menu log with self pick up to save time, even leaving ten mins after we scheduled and still waited a good 15 mins. The order was written down for them, but poor attention to detail and poor quality control, has let them down. Here is my first review from January: Out of all the places I could have went to in the city for my lunch break I chose this place. I was attracted to and excited by their 49 x five star reviews. So my expectations were high. I got the cheese burger and chips. The chips nothing to write home about. The burger, I asked for a cheeseburger and not sure what I got, but it left a foul taste in my mouth for 12 hours. The burger was quite small. I won't be rushing back. Their website says any issues, let them know. I texted and asked what the foul stuff on the burger was, but no reply. Edit update: the store owner has made contact apologising for the over zealous indulgence of French onion mustard which he admits would have ruined the burger. He sounds sincere and I put my experience down to a one off (hopefully).

We went in and as soon as the manager saw us he instantly showed us attitude by sighing urgh, “having here?” He said.I said yes. Then he is silent didn’t say anything except looking upset. And then I asked him are you still open, he didn’t say anything again except staring at me.(on the website they said they close at3am)Then I said if we can not have it here you can tell me. Then he told me they are having too many online orders and they have something else to do so they can not serve us. Then we left upset like 2 sewage rats being kicked out just because we want to try the food there.

I’ll definitely recommend to my network working or travelling in Melbourne city. 😋👍 | A very nice Sri Lankan restaurant. We went for lunch and it wasn't too busy. We tried a few types of kottu, some hoppers, and the deviled chicken. Everything was full of flavor and well-balanced. The chili oil that came with the deviled chicken was especially spicy and taste really good. Just a heads-up, if you ask for your food spicy, they take it seriously.
