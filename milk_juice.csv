They use Amazonia for their acai bowls, and the quality is unmistakable. The smoothie bowls are THIIIIIICK with a perfect, impressive consistency that you rarely find. As someone who still makes homemade smoothie bowls daily, I can confidently say these bowls are just as good, if not better. What really blew me away were the toppings. They are so generous, not just for show, but actually loaded with all the good stuff – fresh fruit, crunchy granola, and other delightful additions. It’s not just about the aesthetics here (although they are definitely Instagram-worthy); these bowls truly deliver on taste and nutrition. This is exactly what an acai or smoothie bowl should be – satisfying, nutrient-dense, and absolutely delicious. I was also impressed to learn that SolBowl uses only organic ingredients, showing their commitment to providing the highest quality for their customers. You can taste the difference, with everything feeling fresh, wholesome, and carefully curated. Having already established three stores in Sydney, SolBowl has finally made its way to Melbourne, and it’s sure to be a hit! Whether you’re a die-hard smoothie bowl fan or someone who just loves a good, healthy meal on the go, SolBowl is a must-visit. Their passion for feel-good, good-mood food is evident in every bowl, and I can’t wait to go back! … [Follow my adventures on instagram @crushinglimits]",-37.8130897,144.9587073,,"Shop 1/456 Lonsdale St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",http://www.solbowl.au/,ChIJW4neqE9d1moRliIUP-JuVFc,Cafe,3000

I have to say, it was an absolutely delightful experience. From the moment I took my first sip, I was hit with a refreshing blend of flavors that felt perfectly balanced. The iced tea itself was just the right level of sweetness, with the lemon providing a zesty, citrusy kick that was both invigorating and palate-cleansing. It’s one of those drinks that feels like it was tailor-made for a hot day, offering a cool and crisp taste that quenches your thirst almost immediately. What surprised me the most was how fresh and natural the lemon flavor tasted; it wasn’t artificial at all, which is something I really appreciate in a beverage. I ordered the standard size ($8.50) with normal sugar. 🍦🥄 Now, let’s talk about the star of the show—the yogurt mousse layer on top. This was an absolute game-changer! The mousse was incredibly light and fluffy, almost like a whipped cream but with a distinct, tangy yogurt taste that added a creamy dimension to the drink. It was slightly sweet but had a tartness that perfectly complemented the underlying lemon tea. The combination of the tangy mousse and the sweet-tart lemon tea was a match made in heaven. I found myself savoring each sip, trying to get just the right balance of mousse and tea in every mouthful. The way the mousse slowly mixed into the tea as you drank it was a delightful visual treat, creating this beautiful swirling pattern that made the drink look as good as it tasted. It’s the kind of unique twist that makes Machi Machi’s drinks stand out from the typical bubble tea shops. The texture was another highlight for me. The contrast between the smooth, creamy mousse and the light, refreshing tea was spot on. As the mousse started to melt into the tea, it gave the drink a velvety mouthfeel that I found incredibly satisfying. It almost felt like you were drinking a dessert, making it a perfect option if you’re craving something sweet but not overly indulgent. The drink was well-crafted, with a perfect balance between the tea’s natural bitterness, the lemon’s tartness, and the yogurt’s creamy texture. I also appreciated the quality of the ingredients used—the tea had a rich, full-bodied flavor, and the lemon didn’t taste artificial or overly sour. You could tell a lot of thought and care went into crafting this drink, making it a standout option on their menu. 🏡💁‍♀️ The ambiance of Machi Machi itself was another pleasant surprise. The shop has a bright, welcoming vibe with a modern aesthetic that’s both clean and inviting. It’s the kind of place where you could easily take it to go and continue to your work. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. 🥳💯 Overall, I highly recommend trying the Lemon Yogurt Mousse Iced Tea at Machi Machi if you’re looking for something different and refreshing. It’s a unique twist on the typical iced tea, combining the tartness of lemon with the creamy tang of yogurt mousse, resulting in a well-balanced, delicious drink. The experience was memorable, and it’s one of those drinks that I’ll definitely be coming back for, especially on a warm day. It’s a must-try for anyone who enjoys creative and thoughtfully crafted beverages. Machi Machi has definitely earned a new regular customer in me, and I can’t wait to explore more of their menu offerings in the future!",-37.8100292,144.96165180000003,,"260 La Trobe St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",http://www.machimachi.com.au/,ChIJcfj-DShD1moRYDXgZCwF3Ig,Milk Tea,3000

Honestly, it's one of the best brands I've tried lately. My favourite is the OG Pearls Milk. It hits the perfect balance of black tea, milk, and pearls. Its taste brings me back to the classic milk tea I had years ago in Taiwan. I guess that’s why it’s called OG– it really nails that original flavour. Coming in second is the Amber Whisper Roasted Oolong. The A2 milk used here pairs beautifully with the oolong, not too strong in taste, but the rich aroma of roasted oolong is still very present and smooth. Third place for me is the Ripe Black Pearls. It’s decent, but since it shares the same black tea base as OG Pearls Milk, I didn’t find it as memorable. Still a nice option if you’re into classic black milk teas. My least favourite was the Spring Moss Green. I know green tea is generally light but the green tea favour in this drink was a bit too light and the A2 milk overpowered the tea. That said, it might still suit those who prefer a milder taste or want something light before bed. Overall, this place delivers good milk teas with high quality ingredients.

Its teas are aromatic, layered, and distinctly tea-driven, on par with Charlie’s Tea in the CBD. The beautifully designed cups add an artistic touch that elevates the overall experience. Detail : Recently, I visited Camellia, a hand-crafted tea brand in Melbourne recommended by a friend. Its branding and tea-forward profile immediately reminded me of China’s well-known chain CHAGEE, which also highlights rich tea bases and a clean, lingering finish. Unlike many bubble tea shops, Camellia does not offer add-on toppings, focusing instead on the purity of its teas and milk teas. This approach allows the tea’s aroma and body to stand out more distinctly, showcasing the quality of the leaves themselves. In terms of taste, the tea is clear, layered, and distinctly aromatic — a strong tea-driven style. Overall, I would place Camellia alongside Charlie’s Tea as one of the standout hand-crafted tea brands in Melbourne’s CBD.

I ordered the taro ball series and it was exactly what I needed. Light, chewy, refreshing and not overly sweet. The toppings were generous and everything tasted fresh. I loved the texture mix — soft taro, bouncy jelly, chewy balls, and shaved ice all in one bowl. It brought back night market memories for me.

The brand is originally from Xi’An, China— it’s not homegrown like Top Tea. I’ve tried almost all their milk teas and can say they are of good quality and can stand out from the rest of the shops. You can order online as well, the shop is takeout only— no seating, but the outside concrete planter isn’t too bad to have a seat for a bit. It’s never too busy so it’s really good if you don’t want to wait >30 minutes for another shop. The price point is the same as other shops ($7.80) ~$7.92 after card surcharge. It’s nearby RMIT and a short walk from Melbourne Central. Their Signature Jasmine Milk Tea is as good (maybe better) than Molly Tea. Dark Milk Tea is probably the most unique from the shop as it is flavoured with sea salt. My ranking: 1. Jasmine / Dark Milk Tea 2. Osmanthus Oolong / Longjing 3. Rock Oolong / Grape Oolong 4.
